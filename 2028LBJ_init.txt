When even North Korea collapsed due to China's weakening, Trump became a leader who unified the Korean Peninsula without doing anything. In a desperate situation, a 'special gift' appeared before the eyes of the American people on Christmas 2025.",

His successor, Nixon, resigned in disgrace due to Watergate, and Carter, unfortunately, showed insufficient ability in the end. Reagan and Bush believed in neoliberalism and destroyed his Great Society, and Clinton seemed to compromise rather than overcome neoliberalism. Dubya showed more incompetence than himself, who had to lead the Vietnam War with neoconservative policies. Obama promised change, but instead of solving these problems, he worsened the Middle East and East Asia problems and cooperated with the vested interests within the Democratic Party. Biden made some efforts to solve them, but he was too old. They called he was 'old-fashioned', but they had been doing stupid things while he was away, and LBJ finally known./n LBJ was furious, but finally calm. and he decided run for re-election in 2028.",
